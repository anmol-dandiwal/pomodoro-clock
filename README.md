# pomodoro-clock
This project is a timer for the Pormodoro Technique, where one takes 5 minute breaks between 25 minute intervals while working to increase productivity.

This timer allows the user to simultaneously time working sessions and breaks, as well as being able to customize how long sessions and breaks last.
